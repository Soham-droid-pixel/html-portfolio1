# 🌐 Soham Kalgutkar's Portfolio – First HTML Project 💻

> 🎉 One of my **earliest web development projects** built entirely with **pure HTML** as I began learning how websites are made — one tag at a time.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This is a **basic static portfolio website** created to showcase a couple of fun beginner projects, including:

* 🎬 A **Movie Ranking Project** where I listed my favorite movies
* 🎂 A **Birthday Invite Project** with event details and an image
* 📄 Basic "About Me" and "Contact Me" pages

Everything was structured using only **HTML elements**, with no CSS or JavaScript — just raw HTML magic! ✨

---

## 🧱 Key Concepts I Practiced

* Creating structured web pages using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images
* Linking between different HTML pages and external URLs
* Using `hr`, `ul`, `a`, and `img` tags to organize content
* Building a multi-page layout without any frameworks or libraries
* Keeping things simple, semantic, and well-organized

---

## 🌐 What’s Inside

* **Movie Ranking Page** – A fun page listing some of my favorite movies
* **Birthday Invite** – A cute little invitation complete with a cake image and checklist
* **Navigation** – Links to “About Me” and “Contact Me” pages for better structure

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This wasn’t just a small HTML project —
It was the **first time I felt like I actually built a website**.

That feeling of running it in the browser and seeing:

> *"Soham Kalgutkar’s Portfolio"*
> was priceless. 💫

## 💡 Lessons Learned

* Writing well-structured HTML documents
* Building confidence to move from "just learning" to "actually creating"
* Understanding how real-world portfolios can begin with the simplest tools
* The joy of seeing your work live in a browser — even if it's just locally!

## 🚀 What’s Next

This project laid the foundation for everything that followed —
From learning CSS and JavaScript to building full-stack apps and deploying real websites.

It reminds me where it all started, and how far I’ve come — one line of code at a time.

## 🙌 Made with ❤️

By **Soham Kalgutkar** as part of my early journey into web development.
Simple. Clean. Nostalgic. And 100% handwritten HTML.
